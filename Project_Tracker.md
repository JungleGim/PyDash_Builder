# PyDash Config Editor Readme
WIP readme for the PyDash configuration editor

## Version
Version: 0.0
Build Date: 11/17/2025

# Global TODO list
* Make a companion "font installer" method
    - need to handle HTML links in the custom message pop-up.
    - I mean, don't NEED to, but in order to nicely put some inline links it would be ideal
						
# Finalization
* When all done with first rev
    - Make a whole new dash configuration from scratch with the builder and then test if it functions with the pydash app. IT HAS TO BE SEAMLESS so make sure its completely working.
    - upload the PyDash Builder github
        + update the github readme including future updates, etc.
        + do an executable build for windows (see next bullet point)
    - use PyInstaller to make a condensed executable
        + would be preferred so people can/could just run the whole prog w/o needing python, libraries, etc.
        + also if that works on windows, look at getting a Mac Mini so can run PyInstaller on MacOS
        + put the pyinstaller executables in the "release" part of the git page

# Future Updates
Include any items below in the appropriate README.md file section

* code documentation
    - make a full user guide word file / PDF and upload to github
